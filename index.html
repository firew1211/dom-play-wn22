        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Hi, son.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: Hi, dad.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Son, it seems you have not been paying attention in class, and this clearly shows in your marks card. Also, I do not see you reading your books while you are at home too. Don’t you think you should start taking your studies more seriously?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: Yes, dad. I find a school to be so boring. I want to quit and travel the world.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Son, how will you pay for your tickets? Or even food for that matter?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: I will figure something out, dad.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Son, you need to understand something. Education is a very important part of your life. It may not seem like that now, but that is because your mother and I have sheltered you from the harsh realities of the world. But as you grow older, you will realize the importance of having a good job. Your education is like an “entry pass”, allowing you to work and establish yourself. So, you must study and take your school seriously.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son:  But dad, I do not want to study. I feel that none of these subjects will become useful as an adult. Like, I have never seen anyone outside my school use Pythagoras theorem in their day-to-day life. I have also never seen anyone talking about Shakespeare and his plays other than in my English class.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Son, you may not see it, but the world runs on maths and science. How will you buy food if you cannot perform simple calculations? How will you use a computer if you are not familiar with the basics?</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Son, this may seem unappealing right now, but when you are an adult, you will be thankful. Remember, investing in one’s yourself is the greatest thing you can ever do. And education is one of those things. It can eventually let you achieve success in life.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: Wow, dad! I think I will start taking my studies more seriously. I want to learn and invest in myself.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: From today, I will start paying more attention in my class and also dedicate time at home for learning new things. I am so glad I had this conversation with you, dad.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: Remember, son, you have your whole life ahead of you. Do not waste it in things that do not help you learn or grow as an individual. Your mother and I are always here if you need anything from us.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Son">Son: Thank you, dad. I love you.</span></p>
        <p><span data-actor="Father">Father: I love you too, son.</span></p>
